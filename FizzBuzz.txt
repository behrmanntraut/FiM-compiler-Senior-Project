Dear Princess Celestia, FizzBuzz:
	
	Today I learned about the mane paragraphs.
		Did you know that my check is now the logic false?
		For every number fizzBuzz from 1 to 100,
			my check is now modulus using fizzBuzz and 3.
			When my check,
				my check is now modulus using fizzBuzz and 5.
				When my check,
					I said "FizzBuzz"!
				Otherwise,
					I said "Fizz".
				That's what I would do!
			Otherwise,
				my check is now modulus using fizzBuzz and 5.
				When my check,
					I said "Buzz".
				Otherwise,
					I said fizzBuzz.
				That's what I would do!
			That's what I would do!
		That's what I did!
	That's all about about the mane paragraphs.
	
	I learned modulus using number mod using number div with logic,
		Did you know that my answer is now the logic false?
		For every number x from 1 to 5000...
			When mod was less than 1,
				When mod was 0.
					my answer is now the logic true.
				That's what I would do!
			That's what I would do!
			mod is now mod without div.
		That's what I did!
		Then you get my answer.
	That's all about modulus!

Your faithful student, Brandon Ehrmanntraut!
