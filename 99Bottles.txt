Dear Bipity Bopity, Bottles on the wall:

	Today I learned about the mane paragraphs.
		
		For every number my num from 1 to 100,
			I said the number 100 without my num,
			I said "Bottles on the wall, take one down pass it around".
			When my num was the number 100,
				I said "No more bottles on the wall".
			That's what I would do.
		That's what I did.
	That's all about about the mane paragraphs.

Your faithful student, Brandon Ehrmanntraut!
